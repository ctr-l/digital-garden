The Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Advancing responisble State beehaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security is established by the [[United Nations|UN]] General Assembly. 

6 iterations of the GGE have been convened since 2004, with 4 of the GGes adopting a consensus report (the last one was in 2021).

Significantly, the 2013 consensus report affirmed the idea that UN member states should abide by international law when operating in cyber space.[^1] In addition, it also stated that State sovereignty and existing international norms and principles also apply. These conclusions seem to echo the rules found in the [[Tallinn Manual]].
