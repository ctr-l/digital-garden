title: Cyber Warfare and relevant laws
---
There are two separate domains in which the rights and laws of armed conflict apply. Part IV of the [[Tallinn Manual]] provides some rules in relation to cyber warfare.

## Jus ad bellum
**Jus ad bellum** - these are the principles that govern the right to go to war

Some principles of jus ad bellum:[^1]

1. War should be waged by a proper and legitimate authority, following proper processes.

The question of who has legitimate authority here is a difficult one to answer. Is it an individual whose rights are infringed? Or is the legitimacy rooted in the existence of the nation state?

The [[unique nature of cyber space]] also makes this a difficult question to answer.

2. War must be waged with right intentions, motivated by just cause.

Traditional just war theory recognises only 2 types of justifications: national defence and humanitarian intervention

What is a just cause in the cyber space? What sort of national interests can be justified?

3. Proportionality

The beefits of war need to be proportional or worth the costs incurred. This is further complicated in cyber space.

## Jus in bello

**Jus in bello** - these are the principles that govern the action of war
- This is mostly international humanitarian law, which limits the effects of armed conflict
- The body of law is made up of different laws in a treaty signed by countries
- Geneva Convention Centre Additional Protocols
