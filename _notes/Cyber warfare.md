title: Cyber Warfare and relevant laws
---
There are two separate domains in which the rights and laws of armed conflict apply. Part IV of the [[Tallinn Manual]] provides some rules in relation to cyber warfare.

Jus ad bellum - these are the principles that govern the right to go to war

Jus in bello - these are the principles that govern the action of war
- This is mostly international humanitarian law, which limits the effects of armed conflict
- the body of law is made up of different laws in a treaty signed by countries
- Geneva Convention Centre Additional Protocols

Five principles of jus ad bellum, how they may apply in the context of cyber warfare

1. War should be waged by a proper and legitimate authority, following proper processes.

Who has legitimate authority - what about if it's an individual whose rights are infringed? Is waging war justified to protect individual rights - does an individual have the right to wage war if their rights are at risk of being infringed? Or does is this legitimacy rooted in the existence of the nation state?

Cyber warfare: who even are the legitimate authorities? Cyber warfare is usually covert, and carried through proxies of nation states - are these legitimate? Would a nation state ever agree or admit that they have a proxy committing cyber warfare for them? What if the proxies are operating outside of the country (jurisdictional issues)?

2. War must be waged with right intentions, motivated by just cause.

Traditional just war theory recognises only 2 types of justifications: national defence and humanitarian intervention

What is a just cause in the cyber space? What sort of national interests can be justified?

3. needing to determine probability of success / just peace

Can be very difficult to apply

5. Proportionality

I.e. the benefits of war must be proportional or worth the costs encountered. Judged based on assessment of damages, extremely difficult.

6. Last resort (necessity)

When diplomacy has been exhausted, etc.
