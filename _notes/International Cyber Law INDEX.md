title: Cyber Law at the International Level
---
"The regulation of cyber space at the international level is rapidly developing, predominantly driven by the dual processes being pursued by States through the [[United Nations]] [[Group of Governmental Experts]] and the [[Open Ended Working Group]]. The mandates of both groups significantly overlap, although have different compositions."[^1]

Other coordinated efforts at developing a cohesive international framework for regulating the cyber space also exist, including the [[Tallinn Manual]].
