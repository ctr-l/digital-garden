title: International Regulation of the Cyber Space
---
"The regulation of cyber space at the international level is rapidly developing, predominantly driven by the dual processes being pursued by States through the [[United Nations]] [[Group of Governmental Experts]] and the [[Open Ended Working Group]]. The mandates of both groups significantly overlap, although have different compositions."[^1]

[[INDEX Australian government bodies|Australian engagement with international cyber law]] through the UN has been strong. Other prominent intergovernmental organisations involved in the regulation of the cyber space include the [[Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]].

Other non-State efforts to develop a cohesive international framework for regulating the actions of nations in cyber space have also been coordinated, including the [[Tallinn Manual]].[^2]

As international law primarily governs the relationship between States, and focuses on subjects pertaining to the cyber space such as cyber crime and [[cyber warfare]].

Consequently, international law has been [[Criticisms|criticised]] for being inadequate in [[sufficiency of international law in addressing non state actors|regulating the behaviour of non-State actors]].
