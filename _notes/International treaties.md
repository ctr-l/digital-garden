Potential issues

would a country like to be handicapped by agreeing to a treaty to not be able to deliver cyber weapons

cynical view - laws are for weak countries that don't apply for the strong

jurisdictional access - the internet has no boarders
law enforcement must be able to track criminal activity across the entire internet -> requires access to data; violation of sovereignty and privacy
