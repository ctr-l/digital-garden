# What is it
The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare ('**Tallinn Manual**') is an academic study on how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare. 

You can access a copy of it [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/tallinn-manual-20-on-the-international-law-applicable-to-cyber-operations/E4FFD83EA790D7C4C3C28FC9CA2FB6C9).

It is a collaborative effort between policy and legal experts, and is ultimately non-binding. 

## A brief history
The first edition was published in 2013, focusing on cyber operations involving the use of force, and those that occur in the context of armed conflict.

The second edition was released in 2017 and expands on the first edition by considering the public interntational law that governs cyber operations during peacetime.

The [[Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]] ('**CCDCOE**') is currently working on the 3rd edition of the Tallinn Manual.

## Legal authority
It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual is "not an official document" and "must be understood only as an expression of the opinions of the two International Groups of Experts as to the state of the law".[^1]

Essentially, the Tallinn Manual is a reflection of the law that existed at the time of publication. It is not a guide for best practices. It does not reflect any development in the law. It does not provide policy considerations. 

> **Some fun legal terms ðŸ’¡**
> 
**Lex lata** - the law as it is
> 
> **Lex ferenda** - the law as it should be

So, the Tallinn Manual is a restatement of *lex lata*, rather than *lex ferenda*.

## Scope

Jus ad bellum" - the conditions under which States may resort to war, or the use of armed forces

"Jus in bello" - regulates the conduct of parties engaged in an armed conflict
