The general principle of due diligence as articulated in the Tallinn Manual requires a state to exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its government control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for other States.[^1]

To comply with the due diligence principle, a State must take all actions that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber pperations that affect a right of, and produce serious aderse consequences for, other States.[^2]

However, the [[unique nature of cyber space]] makes it difficult to attribute responsibility for unlawful cyber operations.
