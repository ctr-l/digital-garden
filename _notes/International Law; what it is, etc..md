International law attempts to define the legal responsibilities of nations in their conduct with each other and also their treatment of individuals within State boundaries. In turn, its scope is broad, covering a variety of issues such as human rights and disarmament.

As such, international law on cyber security mainly concerns State actors than non-State actors.

1. International conventions
2. International custom
3. General principles of law recognised by nations
