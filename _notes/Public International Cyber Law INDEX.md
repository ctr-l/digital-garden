title: International Cyber Law Aimed at Regulating States
---
"The regulation of cyber space at the international level is rapidly developing, predominantly driven by the dual processes being pursued by States through the [[United Nations]] [[Group of Governmental Experts]] and the [[Open Ended Working Group]]. The mandates of both groups significantly overlap, although have different compositions."[^1]

[^1]: From the [Australian Cyber Law Map](http://austlii.community/foswiki/CyberLaw/AustralianCyberLawMap/InternationalCyberEngagement).

Other coordinated efforts at developing a cohesive international framework for regulating the actions of nations in cyber space also exist, including the [[Tallinn Manual]].

Prominent organisations:
- [[United Nations|UN]]
- [[GFCE]]
- [[Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]]

Despite this, public international law still primarily governs the relationship between states and has bene viewed as inadequate in regulating the behaviour of non-state actors.
