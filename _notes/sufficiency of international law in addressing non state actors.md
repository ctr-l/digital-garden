title: Is international law sufficiently addressing the actions of non-state actors?
---
multiple perspectives

probably no

derives from the way international law developed (this is why i should explore how international came about, sources, etc...)

Most critics do not believe international law is sufficiently addressing the actions of non-State actors. Given the nature and [[International Law; what it is, etc.|sources of international law]], this may be an intrinsic flaw of relying on the international legal system to regulate actions in the cyber space.

As seen through the work performed by the [[Open Ended Working Group]] and [[Group of Governmental Experts]], there is an overt focus on establishing norms to regulate the cyber space. However, the current shape of international law may be "incoherent with the dominance of nonstate actors as *de facto* operators of cyber space."[^1] Norms such as states should essentially undertake actions to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs were proposed in the work performed by the [[Open Ended Working Group]] and the [[Group of Governmental Experts]].
