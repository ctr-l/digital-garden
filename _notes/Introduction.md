Hi! Just thought I'd say a few things about this project of mine before you get started on your exploration.

...

initial thoughts
- interested in international stuff
- expanding cyber law map seems pretty interesting 
- wanted to make something accessible while also learning more myself

why a digital garden n not a blog
- too fixed vs very malleable
- opportunity to create links -> visual is always good for understanding

scope of project
- started with looking at the "international engagement" section of the cyber law map
-
