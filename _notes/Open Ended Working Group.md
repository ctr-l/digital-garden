### What is an Open-Ended Working Group?
As the name suggests, these are a format or process used in the [[United Nations|UN]] that is considered the most open - they allow the participation of all UN member states and others, such as:
- the private sector
- NGOs
- academics

Compared to the [[Group of Governmental Experts]], the OEWG format is much more open as it consults with all interested stakeholders while consultations for the GGE are limited to Member States.

Many OEWGs exist, tackling a large variety of issues, such as ageging and prevention of corruption. 

An open-ended working group on **developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security** was formed in by a resolution of the General Assembly in 2018.
