title: Characeristics of cyber space which make it hard to enforce laws
---
The unique nature of cyber space creates immense difficulties in enforcing the law. Below are some characteristics of cyber space and cyber actions which you may wish to consider - you will see that these are usually interconnected.

## 1. Anonymity
Cyber space provides actors with the ability to act with full anonymity, making it difficult at times to trace or locate the actors, thus creating difficulties when establishing sovereignty and jurisdiction.

## 2. Determining authority
Determining authority is an important question to answer when considering the legitimacy of [[cyber warfare]]. 

In the cyber space, who would be considered a legitimate authority? Cyber warfare is usually covert and carried out via proxies. You also face practical questions of whether a State would ever admit that they are engaging in cyber warfare. 

Hackers can also manipulate cyber infrastructure, making it even more difficult to attribute responsibility.

## 3. Size and scale
It is difficult to measure the size of the cyber space and the impacts of any potential actions that may be taken. This has significant repercussions when considering the proportionality of cyber actions.

## 4. Time delays
The nature of cyber space allows delayed detection ofc cyber actions. This creates further barriers in identifying the relevant actors and attributing responsibility.
