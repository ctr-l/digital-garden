title: sovereignty
---
The concept of sovereignty is key to international law. In the concept of international law it essentially means that a government has full control or authority over affairs within a geographical area.[^1]

While international law recognises and seeks to uphold state sovereignty, it also curtails it. Various [[sources of international law]] impose obligations for states to act in a certain way.

Sovereignty is closely tied to the concept of [[territoriality]].
