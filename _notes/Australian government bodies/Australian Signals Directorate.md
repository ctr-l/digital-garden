The ASD's main purpose is to "defend Australia from global threats and help advance Australia's national interests."[^1]

The **Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)** sits within the ASD and leads the efforts on national cyber security. Rather than spreading cyber security capabilities throughout government departments, capabilities are brought together with the Centre. The Centre provides advice and assistance across the economy and not just to the government.[^2]
