The [AFP](https://www.afp.gov.au/), as its name suggests, is Australia's federal law enforcement organisation. In relation to the cyber space, they are responsible for "detecting, preventing, distrupting, respnding to and enforcing cybercrime offences impacting the whole of the Australian economy."[^1]

They also work on the international level, through partnereships with INTERPOL's Cyber Fusion Centre in Singapore and EUROPOL's European Cyber Crime Centre to identify new, imminent and evolving cybercrime threats. Regionally, they lead initiatives such as [Cyber Safety Pasifika](https://www.cybersafetypasifika.org/) and [Cyber Safety Asia](https://cybilportal.org/projects/cybercrime-investigative-capability-in-the-asean-region/) programs to improve regional capacity to deal with cybercrime.
