# Welcome! üå±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
üìç Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[international cyber law]]</span> to get started on your exploration.
</p>

Hi! Just thought I'd say a few things about this little garden of mine before you get started on your exploration.

My initial motivations for making this my project:
- Expanding the existing Cyber Law Map seemed like a great opportunity to learn more about the overall frameworks and regulations that govern the cyber space.
- I've always had an interest in international law.
- This project would force me to relearn HTML, CSS and become more comfortable with Markdown.

So why did I choose a digital garden and not a blog if I just wanted to learn and write about international cyber law?
- I love the idea of a digital garden and would've eventually made one anyways (just for word vomit).
- Digital gardens are about malleability and growth. I felt like this reflected the nature of cyber space and cyber law much better than the fixed nature of a blog.
- It's much easier to create little nuggets of information in a digital garden than a blog where the expectation is to write full-length posts.
- The flexibility associated with this format allows me to create links between notes and create a visual overview, which is much more like a map.
- I wanted to continue learning about this area after the course ends and felt like a digital garden was better for facilitating this.
